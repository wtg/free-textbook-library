From “Spies” (Lang, 1928) to much of Hitchcock’s oeuvre, the genre has made for an inexhaustible set of spaces, plot devices and syntactic layers that restrict viewers, thrill them and construct the visual forms of our greatest personal phobias, social anxieties and conspiracy theories. “Veil and Beam” will examine the architectural and technical aspects of spy cinema, the (often) political agendas of the filmmakers, and provide a close-viewing of the observer ‘observing’ (and being observed). The films studied have a specific relationship to architecture and include The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934 and 1956, Hitchcock); The Third Man (1949, Reed); 5 Fingers (1952, Mankiewicz); North by Northwest (1959, Hitchcock); Dr. No (1962, Young); The Conversation (1974, Coppola); Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy (1980, BBC; and 2011, Alfredson); and a recent masterpiece, The Lives of Others (2006, von Donnersmarck).

More often than not you will depend on the impact and clarity of your portfolio as the primary vehicle for gaining future opportunities, whether in a top tier design office, an academic institution or when applying for commissions. Many of these opportunities are evaluated on the portfolio alone with no space for leveraging the public presentation skills of a seasoned graduating architecture student. More than a mere collection of projects, the portfolio demands a finely crafted set of editorial strategies that encompasses an array of visual representation skills, editorial skills, graphic design, book design and the subtle art of persuasion through non-verbal communication. This seminar requires you to reassess your work and develop a global editorial strategy where you position your entire body of work in the framework of an architectural thesis. Drawings will be remade, renderings will be reworked and regenerated, layouts scrutinized and the conceptual underpinnings of any given project will be interrogated for it’s value and contribution to the larger narrative you will create around your work. The course will not seek to develop a complete portfolio, rather to identify a top level editorial approach and layout in connection with an in depth reassessment and representation of a number of projects. This process will allow you to develop the editorial approach of your portfolio and to clarify the expectations of each page, each project, through the in-depth reassessment of individual projects.

In CPS,  physical and software components are deeply intertwined, each operating on different spatial and temporal scales, and exhibiting multiple and distinct behavioral modalities, and interacting witheach other in a myriad of ways that change with context. Examples of CPS include smart grid, autonomous automobile systems, medical monitoring, process control systems, robotics systems, and automatic pilot avionics. Introduction to CPS provides studentswith the opportunity to learn the different principles entailed in the analysis and design of CPS. In the context of this year's class, the application technology chosen was brain interfaces, motivated by the multitude of initiatives released by Silicon Valley companies that will likely shape the job market landscape. Examples include, for instance, the NeuraLink by Elon Musk, and typing-by-brain from Facebook. Consequently, the interplay between brain (i.e., the physical system) and its interface (i.e., the hardware and software components) will be explored from a practical and formal perspective. Due to the high interdisciplinarity of the topic, the course is structured in four parts: (i) the organization of the brain, and dynamics at different time-scales; (ii) determine the main features and their neurophysiological translation; (iii) classification of the features using statistical analysis and machine learning; and (iv) executing a task in open and closed-loop fashion.\nIn summary,  the students will generally gain an understanding of the fundamental aspects required for the design and analysis of computational systems that are integrated with physical processes. In particular, the students will be equipped with skills and understanding regarding brain interfaces that will uniquely position them in the new market landscape and get a transversional (i.e., interdisciplinary) educational experience.Textbooks: Brain-Computer Interfaces: Principles and Practice by Jonathan Wolpaw.

It can manifest in a variety of ways, like income and wealth inequality, unequal access to education and cultural resources, and differential treatment by the police and judicial system, among others. Social inequality goes hand in hand with social stratification. Social inequality is characterized by the existence of unequal opportunities and rewards for different social positions or statuses within a group or society. It contains structured and recurrent patterns of unequal distributions of goods, wealth, opportunities, rewards, and punishments. Racism, for example, is understood to be a phenomenon whereby access to rights and resources is unfairly distributed across racial lines. In the context of the U.S., people of color typically experience racism, which benefits white people by conferring on them white privilege, which allows them greater access to rights and resources than other Americans.  This course will examine and explore the sociology of inequality from varying theoretical perspectives, how it operates and/or functions within social institutions.","min_credits":4,"max_credits":4,"active":false,"tags":["topics"],"uuid":"4667a9b2-1053-49d4-934c-9a35cc29c092","required_textbooks":[],"recommended_textbooks":[],"course":{"id":"578","shortname":"1980","uuid":"0689a52e-7acf-4990-9f04-a011ca9eeb4e","subject":{"id":"8","shortname":"IHSS","longname":"Interdisciplinary H\u0026SS","uuid":"85ac0fac-3cd3-4772-b789-a145d6727333"}}},{"id":"579","longname":"Songwrit To Reflect Times","description":"How do we \"reflect the times” through songwriting today?

In CPS,  physical and software components are deeply intertwined, each operating on different spatial and temporal scales, and exhibiting multiple and distinct behavioral modalities, and interacting witheach other in a myriad of ways that change with context. Examples of CPS include smart grid, autonomous automobile systems, medical monitoring, process control systems, robotics systems, and automatic pilot avionics. Introduction to CPS provides studentswith the opportunity to learn the different principles entailed in the analysis and design of CPS. In the context of this year's class, the application technology chosen was brain interfaces, motivated by the multitude of initiatives released by Silicon Valley companies that will likely shape the job market landscape. Examples include, for instance, the NeuraLink by Elon Musk, and typing-by-brain from Facebook. Consequently, the interplay between brain (i.e., the physical system) and its interface (i.e., the hardware and software components) will be explored from a practical and formal perspective. Due to the high interdisciplinarity of the topic, the course is structured in four parts: (i) the organization of the brain, and dynamics at different time-scales; (ii) determine the main features and their neurophysiological translation; (iii) classification of the features using statistical analysis and machine learning; and (iv) executing a task in open and closed-loop fashion.\nIn summary,  the students will generally gain an understanding of the fundamental aspects required for the design and analysis of computational systems that are integrated with physical processes. In particular, the students will be equipped with skills and understanding regarding brain interfaces that will uniquely position them in the new market landscape and get a transversional (i.e., interdisciplinary) educational experience.Textbooks: Brain-Computer Interfaces: Principles and Practice by Jonathan Wolpaw.
